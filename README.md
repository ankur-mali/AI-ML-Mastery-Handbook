## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository contains a single, end-to-end Jupyter Notebook (`final_submission.ipynb`) designed as a **comprehensive guide** to modern AI and data science workflows. Whether you‚Äôre exploring global datasets, training deep neural networks, or applying state-of-the-art NLP, this notebook delivers:

* **Global Data Visualization**: Interactive plots of GDP, life expectancy, and population over time using Gapminder data.
* **Deep Learning Workflows**: Building and training neural network models for regression and classification (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch examples).
* **Transformer-based NLP**: Zero-shot text classification with BART-MNLI and custom label sets.
* **Embedding Extraction & Clustering**: Generating DistilBERT sentence embeddings and uncovering hidden patterns via K-Means.
* **Data Preprocessing & Analysis**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) steps.

This notebook is ideal for:

* **Data Scientists & ML Engineers** seeking a compact reference.
* **Researchers & Students** exploring practical deep learning and NLP applications.
* **Developers** wanting to prototype AI pipelines from data ingestion to model inference.
